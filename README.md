This is a small game written in C. <br />
Your task is to collect all the apples while avoiding enemies. <br />
I do not recommend using the source code for learning C.
I wrote this game just for fun :)

## Movement:<br />
 Arrows - move <br />
 Space - shot <br />
 q - open menu <br />
 
Have a good game!
